    <figcaption><small>Carrot Apple Pancakes<p>This recipe is quite savory and sweet.
          It has been widely sought after the world over.  The recipe was thought to
           only be a legend up until its discovery in 1835 by the Spanish explorer 
           Frans Ferdinand.  Knowledge of the recipe was offered in negotiations for
            a peace treaty between Spain and Tobago.

<ul>
<li>1 cup grated carrot</li>

<li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>

<li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>

<li>1 teaspoon grated ginger root</li>

<li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>

<li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>

<li>1/2 cup self-rising flour</li>
</ul>
    </p>
    <br>
<p><h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
<li>Peel and grate enough carrot to fill a 1-cup measuring cup, unpacked. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add grated carrots and salt, and cook, stirring, until carrot begins to lose its raw character and softens only slightly, about 2 minutes. </li>

<li>Transfer carrots into a bowl, and add ginger, cinnamon, white sugar, egg, and lemon juice.  Stir well to combine. Grate apple into the bowl, and stir to combine.</li>

<li>Add self-rising flour, and stir until it disappears. Let batter rest about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in the same skillet used for carrots over medium heat. </li>

<li>Once the butter melts, transfer in about 1/4 cup batter per pancake, and flatten slightly with the back of the spoon. Cook pancakes until browned and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. </li>

<li>Serve topped with an optional spoon of yogurt, maple syrup, and chopped walnuts if desired.</li>
</ol>
