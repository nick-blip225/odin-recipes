        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
Original recipe (1X) yields 12 servings
<ul>
    <li>1 (12-count) package Hawaiian rolls</li>

    <li>1 cup apple pie filling</li>

    <li>2 (0.74 ounce) pouches apple cider powdered drink mix (such as Alpine Spiced Apple CiderÂ®)</li>

    <li>5 tablespoons butter, divided</li>

    <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>

    <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>

    <li>Separate Hawaiian rolls and cut a 1/2-inch slit in the side of each one. Use a finger or the end of a spoon to create a larger opening and a space large enough to fill each roll with about 1 tablespoon filling.</li>

    <li>Roughly chop apple pie filling and add to a bowl. Stir in 1 packet apple cider mix. Spoon filling into the prepared rolls.  </li>

    <li>Melt 4 tablespoons butter and brush each roll on all sides with melted butter. Place rolls on a lined baking sheet. </li>

    <li>Bake rolls in the preheated oven until lightly toasted and golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes. </li>

    <li>Meanwhile, stir together remaining apple cider packet, sugar, and cinnamon in a shallow dish and melt remaining butter.  </li>

    <li>Brush tops of rolls evenly with melted butter and coat each roll in sugar mixture. </li>
</ol>
